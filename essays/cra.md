## Crazy Rich Asians Book Review

Crazy Rich Asians is the Instagram of books. A few years ago, this comparison may have been read as a complement, or perhaps as light-hearted ribbing. But recently the zeitgeist has started to turn against social media in general, and Facebook in particular (Instagram is owned by Facebook). Perhaps the link I want to draw between a book and a social media platform will be seen as serious criticism, and not click-bait. Somehow, I doubt it.

The contrasts between a online photo-sharing platform and a strategically ink-smudged tree carcass are easy enough to imagine, but the similarities between CRA and Instagram came to my mind almost immediately. They were both addicting, and they both made me feel worse. My life looked desaturated when compared to the raucous novelty of my Instagram feed. Perhaps my path through life is particularly dull, but my mental armor does not seem particularly weak - social media use is positively correlated with depression and anxiety. [^fn1] 

The evidence collected so far isn't strong enough to claim a causal link, but it explains my experience with Instagram. The glumness I felt was in some sense external, or at least not consistent with other parts of my mind. I personally thrive in a life governed by routine. Keeping many things static frees up my mind to make slow incremental progress towards my goals. If I had to live it, the life shown on my Instagram feed would *exhaust* me without moving the progress bar of my life forward. And yet I kept pulling-to-refresh. In fact, my departure from Instagram only came after the rise of finstas - a seperate, more private instagram account for close friends. The pressure to find yet another vein in the mountain of my life to mine for social media points was the final straw. To this day, the fact that people have (or perhaps cultivate, or maybe just fake) enough variety in their life to justify an entirely seperate account makes my head spin.

Leaving Instagram (along with many social media platforms) made me more sensitive to the addictive-and-sad sensation that I associated with their use. But books and social media platforms are quite different - why draw a link between Instagram and CRA?
