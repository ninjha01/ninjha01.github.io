## Crazy Rich Asians Book Review

Kevin Kwan's Crazy Rich Asians is the Instagram of books. A few years ago, this comparison may have been read as a complement, or perhaps as a light-hearted jab. But recently the zeitgeist has started to turn against social media in general, and Facebook (which owns Instagram) in particular. So maybe the link I want to draw between a book and a social media platform will be seen as serious criticism, rather than click-bait.

The contrasts between a online photo-sharing platform and a strategically ink-smudged tree carcass are easy enough to imagine, but the similarities between CRA and Instagram came to my mind almost immediately. They were both addicting, and they both made me feel worse. My life looked desaturated when compared to the raucous novelty of my Instagram feed. Perhaps my path through life is particularly dull, but my mental armor does not seem particularly weak - social media use is positively correlated with depression and anxiety. [^fn1] 

The evidence collected so far isn't strong enough to claim a causal link, but it aligns with my experience using Instagram. The glumness I felt was in some sense external, or at least not consistent with other parts of my mind. I personally thrive in a life governed by routine. Keeping many things static frees up my mind to make slow incremental progress towards my goals. If I had to live it, the life shown on my Instagram feed would *exhaust* me without moving the progress bar of my life forward. And yet I kept pulling-to-refresh. In fact, my departure from Instagram only came after the rise of finstas - a seperate, more private instagram account that you use mainly to gossip with close friends. This additional pressure to find yet another vein in the mountain of my life to strip-mine for social media points broke Instagram for me. To this day, the fact that people have (or perhaps cultivate, or maybe just fake) enough variety in their life to justify an entirely seperate account makes my head spin.

But books and social media platforms are quite different - why draw a link between Instagram and CRA? Leaving Instagram (along with many social media platforms) made me more sensitive to the addictive-and-sad sensation that I associated with their use. And in some ways CRA was a stronger vector for this feeling than Instagram, for all its algorithms. Books make your brain do they heavy lifting when you read them - you have to imagine the wizardry when you read Harry Potter rather than simply register it when you *watch* Harry Potter. This is actually a strength of books - when a beloved character dies it happens *inside you* rather than on a screen. So when CRA opens with a character wielding incomprehensible wealth as a weapon against a racist hotel manager, you *feel* righteous and powerful. Until you remember that *your* wealth is all too comprehensible. At least on Instagram you can put a filter on your pictures - perhaps banks should institute a similar feature.

CRA isn't poorly written - in fact I found it hard to put down. While it doesn't spend much time developing its characters, CRA uses its pages to floridly depict oppulence. The descriptions are well-crafted, incorporating art, fashion, and cuisine. Reading the book feels like learning about actual people living actual lives, just like scrolling through Instagram felt like keeping up with the lives of my friends. It avoids the pitfalls of cultural tokenism in my opinion - keeping in mind that I am neither rich nor East Asian. Culture is used as a lens through which wealth is shown. Extravagent art ("He didn’t have any Rothkos or Pollocks or the other dead American artists one was required to hang on the wall in order to be considered truly rich these days.") ardons the walls. Extravagent food (“It’s always guesswork when you’re eating molecular cuisine, even more so when it’s Pacific Rim fusion molecular cuisine.") is consumed. Extravagent fashion ("Astrid was the first to pair a vintage Saint Laurent Le Smoking jacket with three-dollar batik shorts bought off a beach vendor in Bali, the first to wear the Antwerp Six, and the first to bring home a pair of red-heeled stilettos from some Parisian shoemaker named Christian.") is worn.




Just as culture permeates the displays of wealth, the displays of wealth permeate the structure the book. When a character obssesed with the status


The most interesting conflict in CRA is when characters fail to integrate themselves into the wealth driven world.
