# The Complexity Zoo

Time. The food stuff we'll be feeding the bizarre creatures in... the complexity zoo.

Time is a bit weird in the complexity zoo. We don't care about specific amounts like seconds, minutes, or hours. The animals here only eat a shrink-wrapped, pre-processed, don't ask what's in this hotdog form of time. They don't care that it took you five seconds to walk up 5 stairs, just that it took you five steps.

Now that you have something to feed the animals, let's take a look at those bad boys.

Here we have the complexity class P. It contains all the problems we can solve efficiently relative to their size. Searching for a missing sock in a sock drawer, for example. If you have _n_ pairs of socks in your sock drawer, you can pull out each sock and check to see if it's a match in _2n_ steps. Since _2n_ is a polynomial (LINK TO WHAT'S A POLYNOMIAL), we say it's contained in, or a member of the complexity class P (which stands for polynomial)

P is a very useful complexity class - think of problems in P like  beasts of burden. They're _tractable_. You can tame them, and use them to solve important problems. Like organizing socks.

 EXP is a different complexity class
