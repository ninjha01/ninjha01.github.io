# Travel

[Airplane Footage]
Traveling by yourself is very different from traveling with your friends or family. Just as in the rest of life you trade off loneliness for freedom. 

[walking through streets]
You don't have anyone to walk with through foreign streets, but you also don't need to convince anyone to go off the beaten path or take a day to rest.

[Europe Trip slideshow]
After I graduated from college I took the cliche trip through Europe - I hoped it would be a good bookend to that chapter of my life. But for me at least, closing out a chapter requires more _space_. Space that I can fill with my thoughts. Space between me and the rest of my life. Traveling successfully means whittling down your life to fit into a backpack or suitcase. Unlike the rest of life, you have to make decisions about what you want. Rather than the buffet spotify and netflix usually offer, I pick one or two albums and a few books to keep on my phone and that's it. Done right, travel dramatically restricts the mundane decisions we usually have to make and opens up newer, bigger ones. How should I spend my day? What new experience do I want to add into my life. What pieces of art and culture do I want to spend a lot of time with?

Asking these kinds of questions and making these kinds of decisions in a new environement that's both _physically_ and psychologically far away from the rest of my life makes it easier to reflect on home my life has gone so far.

I took a trip recently with such an aim in mind. I had recently come off a particularly unfruitful period of my life. I had failed to make any substantial progress towards the goals I had set up, and even worse I had known I was drowning and hadn't made any effort to get a life preserver or swim towards a life raft.

So I took a flight across the country hoping a few days surrounded by natural beauty would still the choppy waters of my heart.

# Unproductivity


# Job/Career
[Video of coding]
Programmer. Software Engineer. Coder. Developer. Code Monkey. There a bunch of titles that generally describe what I do, but I always think of myself as a text editor. One of the secrets of computer programming is that a program is just text. The big difference between an email you send asking someone for help and the program sending the email is that the text of the email is written to get a human being to do what you want and the text of the program is written to tell computers to do what the author wanted.

This is obviously a simplification, but the point is that nearly all programming involves maninpulating text to make computers do different things.

[People being bad at computers]
As a kid, I noticed that the adults who used the keyboard more than the mouse were better at using the computer than the ones who kept switching between the two. I don't know if that's a general law, but I've carried the same heuristic in my head to this day.
The fewer times I need to use the mouse to do my job, the more efficient I am, or at least the more efficient I _feel_ which is important in its own right. Some videogames make you feel like you're piloting a Mark II while hungover and some make you feel like a badass. It's sounds lame to say out loud, but I want to feel like a badass when I'm working. I do! And without getting too far in the weeds, I want to talk about the tool that makes me feel like a badass.

In the cyber-meta-virtual-digimatrix, there's two main ways of writing programs. An Integrated Development Environment or IDE, and text editors. 


[Iron Man footage]
An IDE is like an early iron man suit - you have a lot at your finger tips. The iron man suit has repulsors, missles, laser, you name it. 

[IDE footage]
But it's _heavy_ - in the suit's case, physically and in the IDE's case visually and mentally. All those buttons and menus do things, often very cool things, but that complexity weighs on the mind.

A text editor is like the hulk - it doesn't have bells and whistles like missles or integrated version control but if you point it at the right problem it'll cut right through it.

[Vim footage]

Emacs is in the middle of the Text Editor/IDE spectrum, but lies closer to the text editor side. It's more like the bleeding edge armor. It's lightweight, but very easily customizable - quite possibly _THE_ most customizable program widely used today. Emacs is a programmable text editor - you can write programs that directly modify how it works. And since programs are just text - you can write text that changes and improves how you write text.

I've used Emacs for a little over 3 years, and that process has shaped and molded the editor to suit me. In a world of Ikea furniture and algorithmic timelines, it's rare to be able to forge and hone a tool so that it fits only your hand and your mind.

It reminds me of the Rifleman's Creed.

This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
My rifle is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

Emacs isn't funded by a huge corporation like VS Code and Microsoft. It doesn't hide it's best features behind a paywall or prevent the curious mind from exploring how it works.

Emacs is a piece of software that makes me want to be a better person. It reminds me that if something doesn't work the way I want it to I can and should learn enough to change it. 

# The Return

This trip gave me the space and the time to think about all of these things.

# Rifleman's Creed <= rewrite for emacs
This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
My rifle is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

Without me, my rifle is useless. Without my rifle, I am useless. I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will ...

My rifle and I know that what counts in war is not the rounds we fire, the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make. We know that it is the hits that count. We will hit ...

My rifle is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel. I will keep my rifle clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will ...

Before God, I swear this creed. My rifle and I are the defenders of my country. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.

So be it, until victory is America's and there is no enemy, but peace!
