# The Dark Side

"Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.

Consume you, it will." - Yoda


The dark arts promise power, control, and seduction often for a terrible price.
In popular culture, the going rate for your soul, your humanity, or mental health ranges from deep arcane knoweledge allowing you to bend the very forces of nature to your will, the ability to seduce the hearts and minds of those around you enabling your meteoric rise to riches and power, or the albiet crude yet effective ability to shoot lightning from your fingertips.


The forbidden arts are characterized by Power and Sacrifice. Sometimes they are forbidden because you must sacrifice something sacred, whether it be a devine sacred value such as a soul or your humanity, or a secular one, such as your mental health or your physical appearance. Other times they are forbidden because of the destruction they bring. But either way the dark arts are dark because they defined by their relationship to Power and Sacrifice.


Long ago in a galaxy far far away, the dark side is a souped up supernatural version of amphetamines. You turn to it when faced with a challenge you're struggling to overcome, whether it's the prophecized death of your pregnant wife or a final in a class you haven't attended since syllabus week. The gifts of the dark side are more oriented to combat and destruction, rather than healing and creation. Want to dominate those stronger than you? The dark side has you covered. Want to heal yourself and others? The dark side may still tempt you, but the results will be mixed at best.


In Star Wars, you turn to the dark side out of fear. And like most things we turn to out of fear, it's hard to reccomend. Even leaving aside the grotesque physical changes, you just don't get that much bang for buck.


What about right here, right now? What are the dark arts of the world we live in? And what are the pros and cons?


There's an easy way to find what arts are considered darke in our world - just look at what teenage boys want and how they try to get it. Why teenage boys? Because to be a teenage boy is to be ruled by your desires yet be powerless to bring about their resolution. As a result they are ripe for exploitation by the dark side. Teenage boys want to see their enemies driven before them and hear the lamentations of their women.

We'll start with the lamentations of women. The dark arts are unseemly. That's part of what makes them dark. As such we will have to delve into the murky sludge that is the world of sexual strategy and pick up artists. The unholy bible of this realm is The Game by Neil Strauss. Part documentary, part Prima sexual strategy guide, and part humblebrag, The Game looks the part of a darke arts tome. It's mostly black and the sillhouette's of women that adorns it's cover mean you should purchase the kindle version if you want to read it in public.


"If one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view."
