# The Dark Side

"Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.

Consume you, it will." - Yoda


The dark arts promise power, control, and seduction often for a terrible price.
In popular culture, the going rate for your soul, your humanity, or mental health ranges from deep arcane knoweledge allowing you to bend the very forces of nature to your will, the ability to seduce the hearts and minds of those around you enabling your meteoric rise to riches and power, or the albiet crude yet effective ability to shoot lightning from your fingertips.


The forbidden arts are characterized by Power and Sacrifice. Sometimes they are forbidden because you must sacrifice something sacred, whether it be a devine value such as a soul or your humanity, or a secular one, such as your mental health or your physical appearance. Other times they are forbidden because of the destruction they bring. But either way the dark arts are dark because they defined by their relationship to Power and Sacrifice.


Long ago in a galaxy far far away, the dark side is a souped up supernatural version of amphetamines. You turn to it when faced with a challenge you're struggling to overcome, whether it's the prophecized death of your pregnant wife or a final in a class you haven't attended since syllabus week.


The gifts of the dark side are more oriented to combat and destruction, rather than healing and creation. Want to dominate those stronger than you and tear down the establishment? The dark side has you covered. Want to heal others and build bridges? The dark side may still tempt you, but the results will be mixed at best.


In Star Wars, you turn to the dark side out of fear. And like most things we turn to out of fear, it's hard to reccomend. Even leaving aside the grotesque physical changes, you just don't get that much bang for buck.


What about right here, right now? What are the dark arts of the world we live in? And what are the pros and cons?


For historical, biological, and sociological reasons, most of the darke arts are entirely male focused. Regardless of the reasons this is a disservice to dark lords, dark ladies, and those beyond the binary. When referencing darke texts, I will attempt to broaden their scope to the best of my ability.


There's an easy way to find what arts are considered darke in our world - just look at what teenagers want and how they try to get it. Why teenagers? Because to be 13 is to be ruled by your desires yet be powerless to bring about their resolution. As a result they are ripe for exploitation by the dark side. And what lies in the hearts and minds? They want to see their enemies driven before them and they want to get laid.

We'll start with getting laid. The dark arts are... unseemly That's part of what makes them dark. As such we will have to delve into the murky sludge that is the world of sexual strategy and pick up artists. The unholy bible of this realm is The Game by Neil Strauss. Part memoir, part Prima sexual strategy guide The Game looks the part of a darke arts tome. It's mostly black cover with sillhouettes of women mean you should purchase the kindle version if you'll be reading it in public.

What can this chinstrap-turned-book offer you? Depending on where you're at, it very well could make you better at attracting those you desire. It also could ruin the way you relate to them. In exchange for ~10 hours of your time and the pain of reading a few tortured sex scenes, you'll recieve a few good ideas, plenty of cheesy stock phrases and a framework in which your potential sexual partners are your adversaries. Let me show you what I mean. 

"I don’t alienate ugly people; I don’t alienate those I'm not attracted to. I only alienate the people I want to fuck."

In this framework, you and the object of your desire are chess players on opposite sides of the board. Your moves are various psychological tactics and manipulations with the goal of attracting your opponent. You can neg your opponent, or give them a backhanded compliment designed to lower their self esteem and social presence. You can increase your own social presence by demonstrating social value - whether through canned lines, cold reading or slight of hand tricks. Like chess your goal is to out manouver your opponent, forcing them into a position where they are compelled to surrender to you.


"A frame is an NLP term: It is the perspective through which one sees the world. Whoever's frame - or subjective reality -is the strongest tends to dominate an interaction. Style has all these really subtle ways of keeping control of the frame and getting people to qualify themselves to him. He makes sure that the focus is always on him."


A key concept is that of a _frame_. The Game calls it a "subjective reality", but the concept really boils down to a collection of attributes and the values attached to them. In a seduction attempt, you want to convince your mark to buy into your frame. In a more concrete sense, if you're a bookish nerd your goal is to steer the conversation to a place where being well-read is valued. If you're an athletic jock you want to construct a more physical or sports-oriented frame. Basically, don't just play to your strengths, make others play a game you're strong at.


The sacrifice that The Game extracts is a subtle one, but potentially quite costly.

"It was then that I realized the downside to this whole venture. A gulf was opening between men and women in my mind. I was beginning to see women solely as measuring instruments to give me feedback on how I was progressing as a pickup artist. They were my crash-test dummies, identifiable only by hair colors and a blonde 7, a brunette 10. Even when I was having a deep conversation, learning about a womans dreams and point of view, in my mind I was just ticking off a box in my routine marked rapport. I was developing an unhealthy attitude toward the opposite sex. And the most troubling thing about this new mindset was that it seemed to be making me more successful with women."

Getting better at anything means practicing. Getting better at seduction means practicing seducing, which requires people to practice seducing. Treating people as means to an end is a dangerous step to take, philosophically speaking. While we all do this to some extent, making the decision to treat your potential romantic partners as practice runs, or points to be one, or as an adversary in a psychological game of chess is a risky one.

For a certain kind of person, taking this step is a slippery slope to viewing all interpersonal interactions as adversarial. Like the Dark Side of the force, The Game can lead you towards paranoia where you view women 

"There are men in this world who hate women, who do not respect them, who call them bitches and cunts. These are not PUAs. PUAs do not hate women; they fear them. Simply by defining oneself as a PUA - a title earned solely by the responses of women -  one becomes doomed to derive his entire self-esteem and identity from the attention of the opposite sex, not unlike..."




Good Advice:
"Don't approach with a sexual come on. Learn about her first and let her earn the right to be hit on
An amateur hits on a woman right away. A pro waits 8-10 minutes"

A pickup artist must be the exception to the rule.

The basic format is Find Meet Attract Close

The 3 second rule - you decide whether to approach or not within three seconds

Interrogation is not seduction. Seduction is the art of setting the stage for two people to choose to reveal themselves to each other.


Like many darke arts, it demands a sacrifice. 



"If one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view."
