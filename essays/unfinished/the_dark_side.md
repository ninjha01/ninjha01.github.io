# The Dark Side

"Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.

Consume you, it will." - Yoda


The dark arts promise power, control, and seduction often for a terrible price.
In popular culture, the going rate for your soul, your humanity, or mental health ranges from deep arcane knoweledge allowing you to bend the very forces of nature to your will, the ability to seduce the hearts and minds of those around you enabling your meteoric rise to riches and power, or the albiet crude yet effective ability to shoot lightning from your fingertips.


The forbidden arts are characterized by Power and Sacrifice. Sometimes they are forbidden because you must sacrifice something sacred, whether it be a devine value such as a soul or your humanity, or a secular one, such as your mental health or your physical appearance. Other times they are forbidden because of the destruction they bring. But either way the dark arts are dark because they defined by their relationship to Power and Sacrifice.


Long ago in a galaxy far far away, the dark side is a souped up supernatural version of amphetamines. You turn to it when faced with a challenge you're struggling to overcome, whether it's the prophecized death of your pregnant wife or a final in a class you haven't attended since syllabus week.


The gifts of the dark side are more oriented to combat and destruction, rather than healing and creation. Want to dominate those stronger than you and tear down the establishment? The dark side has you covered. Want to heal others and build bridges? The dark side may still tempt you, but the results will be mixed at best.


In Star Wars, you turn to the dark side out of fear. And like most things we turn to out of fear, it's hard to reccomend. Even leaving aside the grotesque physical changes, you just don't get that much bang for buck.


What about right here, right now? What are the dark arts of the world we live in? And what are the pros and cons?


For historical, biological, and sociological reasons, most of the darke arts are entirely male focused. Regardless of the reasons this is a disservice to dark lords, dark ladies, and those beyond the binary. When referencing darke texts, I will attempt to broaden their scope to the best of my ability.


There's an easy way to find what arts are considered darke in our world - just look at what teenagers want and how they try to get it. Why teenagers? Because to be 13 is to be ruled by your desires yet be powerless to bring about their resolution. As a result they are ripe for exploitation by the dark side. And what lies in the hearts and minds? They want to see their enemies driven before them and they want to get laid.

We'll start with getting laid. The dark arts are... unseemly That's part of what makes them dark. As such we will have to delve into the murky sludge that is the world of sexual strategy and pick up artists. The unholy bible of this realm is The Game by Neil Strauss. Part memoir, part Prima sexual strategy guide The Game looks the part of a darke arts tome. It's mostly black cover with sillhouettes of women mean you should purchase the kindle version if you'll be reading it in public.

What can this chinstrap-turned-book offer you? Depending on where you're at, it very well could make you better at attracting those you desire. It also could ruin the way you relate to them. In exchange for ~10 hours of your time and the pain of reading a few tortured sex scenes, you'll recieve a few good ideas, plenty of cheesy stock phrases and a framework in which your potential sexual partners are your adversaries. Let me show you what I mean.

"I don’t alienate ugly people; I don’t alienate those I'm not attracted to. I only alienate the people I want to fuck."

In this framework, you and the object of your desire are chess players on opposite sides of the board. Your moves are various psychological tactics and manipulations with the goal of attracting your opponent. You can neg your opponent, or give them a backhanded compliment designed to lower their self esteem and social presence. You can increase your own social presence by demonstrating social value - whether through canned lines, magic 


Like many darke arts, it demands a sacrifice. 



"If one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view."
