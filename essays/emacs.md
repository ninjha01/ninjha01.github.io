# Why I Use a Program that's Twice My Age

What's the first program you launch when you boot up your computer? I suspect for most people the answer is Chrome, or if you're especially #woke Firefox. Or maybe you're like a friend of mine, and have the same awe-inspiring psychosis that compels him to launches a Windows VM on his Mac to run the Edge Browser. Listen, I'm not here to judge. Let's talk about how old these programs are. The Edge Browser is 3 years old, and probably has as many users. Chrome is just over a decade old. Firefox is 16 going on 17 and Baby it's time to think. What's the oldest application that the average person uses regularly? Most people these days rarely use a desktop outside of the workplace, and all iOS and Android apps can't be that much older than a decade. In the grand scheme of things, almost all user-facing applications are shockingly young. So then why oh why is the first app I, a seemingly well-adjusted 22 year-old, run a 42 year-old program?

Well, this 42 year-old application is still under active development. In fact the latest update came just a few months ago. And because of this, it's age can actually be considered a strength in some regard. While younger applications are necessarily more modern and accesible, they don't have the over 4 decades of engineering that Emacs can tap into.

# What _is_ Emacs?

So now you might be curious - what exactly is this strange program? It must be something pretty important to warrant 40+ years of continuous development. At the very least it must have a blockchain-based neural net inside it somewhere, right? Well, no. Emacs is a text editor. It displays text on a screen, and lets you edit it. That's its killer app.

And while this may seem like a bit of a let down, think about how important, and actually all encompasing that task is. As a programmer by trade, that's essentially all my job is. I craft and manipulate words, and eventually something interesting happens. But first I have to read and write text. And it's not just writing programs - most white-collar work is just creating and moving and deleting text - emails and spreasheets are essentially all text, and documents and slides usually have a significant textual component as well.

But why fire up emacs over Microsoft Office, or GSuite? For one, and this is a personal opinion, Office is just ugly. GSuite is less so, but it still clutters up the interface less than I'd like. For two, the focus is 

- I had to
  - Makes you think about what and how you're writing
  - Made me think about what a program *WAS*
   - Data/Program duality
- Benefits of a _*text*_ editor
  - Simplicity and Beauty
  - Provides Focus
- lump of clay
- Why not vim?
 - I like having something I carry with me and shape
