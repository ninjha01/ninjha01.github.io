## The End of a Golden Age

_"I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them."_  

Unlike most people, I don't read the news. Also unlike most people, I don't use social media like Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook. But even *I* have noticed that the world, if not already burning to the ground, has at the very least been playing around with the idea. It feels like the end of an era. I've just graduated college, LeBron's left the Cavaliers, and surprise! -  all of our computers are about to stagnate. All three of these phenomena concern a failure to live up to forecasted potential, but two of them involve disappointing my father, so I'm going to talk about the computer thing.

If you've used a desktop or laptop computer, odds are that it was powered by a computer chip produced by the company Intel. If so, it was part of a chain that stretches back to the very first chip Intel produced in the 1970s. But just like you wouldn't confuse a modern human with a *homo erectus*, the modern computer chip can be distinguished from it's ancestors quite easily.  Computers have gotten faster and more powerful at an astonishing rate - to the point where many people replace their smartphone every two years, if not quicker. This has yielded great advancements in [chess](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-real-kings-of-chess-are-computers-1420827071), [surgery](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601378/nimble-fingered-robot-outperforms-the-best-human-surgeons/), and [flying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopilot). Oh and [bachelorette forecasting](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/deep-learning-predicts-abcs-bachelorettebachelor-deeplearning-/). 

One of the greatest winds in computing's proverbial sail has been Moore's Law. It predicts that the density of computer chip doubles every year or so. Computer chips forged under the optimistic gaze of Moore's Law have been better and more reliable than those that were forged the year before. Good computers became cheap and cheap computers became good. My iPad ([Pro 2017](https://browser.geekbench.com/ios_devices/46)), is in many ways actually more powerful than my Macbook Pro ([Retina Late 2013](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/345)). But the era of cheap improvements is over.

But why? What's changed? Just as the improvements in space efficiency foretold by Moore's Law are starting to lag, so too are improvements in thermal efficiency. Computer chips produce a lot heat when they're working. This waste heat is often the limiting factor in the performance of a computer. Most modern computers actually can't be used at their full processing power - if you did, the heat generated would literally [melt the chip itself](https://youtu.be/ohnkD-gjNVQ?t=2m). A portion of every computer chip must now be kept turned off. This portion, called Dark Silicon, cannot be used, inherently limiting the performance of the chip.

<<Discuss Consequences Here>>

The limit imposed by Dark Silicon currently has no viable solution. The industry's approach has been to stall for time by eking out improvements through various clever and complicated ways. It strikes me that this problem might be inherent to the medium of silicon itself, so the solution might be to switch to a computing medium that doesn't suffer from that drawback. The human brain is the most complicated computing machinery humanity has ever seen, but it runs at a stable 98.6ยบ no matter what it's thinking about.

This merging of silicon-based hardware and carbon-based wetware isn't novel - in fact it's rumored that the original script of _The Matrix_ described the machines using humans for computing power, not energy (which is [clearly stupid](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/3822)). Perhaps they too couldn't find a way to escape the heat death that lies latent in silicon.
