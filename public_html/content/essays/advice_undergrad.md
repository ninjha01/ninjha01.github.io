### College Advice ###

Giving advice is hard. When someone comes to me with a hard question that they've been grappling with, I'm always tempted to respond with one of two cop outs. First, it's really easy to just commiserate without actually helping. This strategy is especially tempting because often times it's actually all that the person asking you for help really wants. Secondly, it's really tempting to give really easy, really conservative, lowest common denominator advice. As the saying goes, "for every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong" [^fn1].

This post is my attempt to avoid these two pitfalls. There's nothing wrong with expressing sympathy or looking for simple answers first, but my goal is to highlight some difficult decisions/questions that have to be made in undergrad and give satisfying, non-LCD responses.

Making your advice non-LCD necessarily means making it more specific. It has to be *targeted*. And my target is someone somewhat like myself when I started college. If you're reading this post, I'll go ahead and assume you're at least somewhat similar to me. Seeing as you're reading this on my website, I think that's a safe assumption.
